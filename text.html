    <p>Aesop's Fables, or the Aesopica, is a collection of fables credited to Aesop, a slave and storyteller believed to
        have lived in ancient
        Greece between 620 and 564 BCE. Of diverse origins, the stories associated with his name have descended to
        modern times through a
        number of sources and continue to be reinterpreted in different verbal registers and in popular as well as
        artistic media.

        The fables originally belonged to the oral tradition and were not collected for some three centuries after
        Aesop's death. By that time a
        variety of other stories, jokes and proverbs were being ascribed to him, although some of that material was from
        sources earlier than him
        or came from beyond the Greek cultural sphere. The process of inclusion has continued until the present, with
        some of the fables unrecorded
        before the Late Middle Ages and others arriving from outside Europe. The process is continuous and new stories
        are still being added to the
        Aesop corpus, even when they are demonstrably more recent work and sometimes from known authors.</p>
